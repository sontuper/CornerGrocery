# CornerGrocery
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
CornerGrocery allows users to read a list of items bought at a grocery store, review the number of each item they have purchased, and save a .dat file as backup.

What did you do particularly well?
The program handles the grocery tasks in a seperate class particuly well.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
If I were to improve the code, I would add more information to each item, such as cost, weight, or bought date to allow more data to be analyzed.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
When writing this, serperating what code should be in main or in the class was the most difficult.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Object oriented programming is what I will take away from this the most.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using comments and making the naming conventions easily understandable made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
